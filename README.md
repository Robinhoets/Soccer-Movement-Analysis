# Soccer-Movement-Analysis

Upload GPS data collected by your movement on the soccer field. Allows you to analyze your in game movement 
to improve your knowledge on how you play.


##Code Example
                'tempObj = new LatLonData(tempLat,tempLon,tempSpeed);
                point.add(tempObj);
                ...
                // put points in text area on main frame
                SoccerView.printGPSToPanel(point);'
                
This project was created to enable soccer players to visualize their movement patterns during the course of a game. Often
when we play, we are in the moment and aftwards we cannot remember every detail of a game. It is important to see what you
actually did during a game. This way we can see the positives and negatives of our game play. Most soccer players in the world
don't have hightech monitors or cameras at practice or games. This GPS device and tracker program gives an affordable way that
every soccer player can manage their gameplay and improve.
